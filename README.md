# Color-Game
Created a game where you guess a color based on a randomly generated RGB value.
6 squares are randomly colored, and after incorrect guesses the squares are greyed out.
After a correct guess, all squares are colored to the correct color, as well as the header.
There is a hard mode, which is the default, leaving 6 random squares,
and there is an easy mode which reduces the number of squares to 3.
